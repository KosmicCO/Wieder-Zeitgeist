### Ideas and Game Planning
Go to the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKvFgDTbbY-r4iPnH29gcIORxbTFUmxMPKeQt7Mp1Qk/edit) to see current game ideas and possible implementation steps. For a better idea of what is currently being implemented, go to the Projects tab on this github repo.
### Code Standards
Remember to document code. Here is a helpful [guide](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2015/08/writing-better-javadoc-in-netbeans-ide/) that shows you how to check if your code has been documented thoroughly. Also, order field and method names according to Netbean's auto-organizer, which can be configured in `Tools / Options / Editor / Formatting` and changing the Catagory to `Ordering`.
